Order of codes to run (notebook headings are self-explanatory):

1) generate_data-ESA.ipynb
2) elements_from_Cartesian.ipynb
3) mcmc_ESA_Zeus.ipynb

mcmc_ESA_Zeus.ipynb is an example sampler for the ESA data. But it is not complete and has not resulted in converged posteriors yet. But there are differences in the L(t) calculations from the Keplerian mcmc because of differing parameterizations so nearly complete version is given here.
